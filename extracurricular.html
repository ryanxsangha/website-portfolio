					<h3>TRAVELLING</h3>
					<p>I have a passion for travelling and exploring<br>
 new places. Whether it's a hike through the<br>
 mountains, a bike ride on a trail, or riding ATVs<br>
 through Mexico's hills, I am usually up for it.</p>

					<h3>GYM</h3>
					<p>I've learned that committing yourself to the<br>
 gym can be a humbling experience. At first,<br>
 it was difficult for me to maintain my hard<br>
 work ethic because I wouldn't immediately<br>
 see results. Going to the gym over the<br>
 years has taught me the importance of being<br>
 hardworking and consistent.</p>

					<h3>SPORTS</h3>
					<p>I've always enjoyed playing many sports, <br>
ranging from golf and tennis to basketball<br>
 and volleyball. Playing sports from an <br>
early age taught me to be strong and <br>
competitive while being able to think <br>
decisively on the fly. I enjoy playing as<br>
 many sports as I can because it allows me<br>
 to remain mentally and physically sharp. <br>
Running a few games of basketball is also a<br>
great way to spend time with some friends.</p>
