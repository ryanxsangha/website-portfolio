					<h3>Wordle Solver</h3>
					<video controls src="images/WordleSolver.mp4" width="400"></video>
					<p>Wordle is a game in which a player has 6 attempts to guess the 5-letter word of the day. I created
 a program that uses a list of potential words as well as feedback from each turn to assist in solving the wordle every time.</p>

					<h3>Words per Minute</h3>
					<img src="images/wpm2.PNG" height="100" translateX(50px)>
					<p>After practicing with python's time package, I was able to build a words per minute calculator. This
 program asks the user to type a phrase and calculates the user's WPM based on the amount of time taken for the user to enter the phrase.</p>

					<h3>AI Face Detector</h3>
					<video controls src="images/AIFaceDetector.mp4" width="400"></video>
					<p>This project uses OpenCV haarcascade files to read in a picture and evaluate whether or not the image
 contains a face. If a face and eyes are recognized, they are highlighted with boxes.</p>
